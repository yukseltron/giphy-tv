# giphy-tv


Search and watch GIFs on a digital tv screen.




# Made with 

[Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)

and [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/)

and [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/)

and a little bit of ❤️




# Planned updates:

• Allow for gif searching based on rating (ie pg, pg-13, R).

• Build a schedule to run certain types of gifs based on actual time, similar to a typical tv station.

• Find a way to intergrate music relative to the gif searched for and found.
